**Location:** Tampere, Finland  

As an experienced Machine Learning Engineer, skilled in deep learning, computer vision, image processing, Large  
Multimodal Models (LMM), model deployment, and synthetic data generation, I am proficient in Python, PyTorch,  
Docker and have a strong experience with multimodal large language models, object detection, camera calibration,  
scene understanding for ADAS, LiDAR, sensor fusion, 3D simulation environments, and high-performance computing  
(HPC). I have recently published a peer-reviewed paper DeepBrownConrady in IEEE-TASE, as the first author.  
Additionally, I am experienced with SLURM workload management, cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP), large-scale data  
processing, and version control with Git.

## Professional Experience  

### AILiveSim Ltd, Finland.  
**Machine Learning Engineer**  
*October 2022 – Present*  

- Built an asset description and retrieval pipeline using Unreal Engine metadata, integrated LongCLIP for multimodal encoding, and stored embeddings in a Chroma vector database for fast similarity search.  
- Generated synthetic data resembling real datasets by tweaking parameters in 3D environments.  
- Developed an Object Detection model for the Maritime Environment using Synthetic Data.  
- Engineered a sophisticated decomposition technique within the ResNet model, focusing on the computation of projection matrices and orthogonal components tailored for PCA analysis.  
- Implemented camera calibration using single images from simulated data to predict horizontal field-of-view (H-FOV), Brown-Conrady distortion parameters, and calculated the intrinsic camera matrix (K-matrix).  
- Generated LiDAR point clouds and performed voxelization to enhance scene understanding in simulated environments.  
- Leveraged LLaVA/LLaMA large language and multimodal models to automate scene descriptions and improve AI interaction with simulated scenes.  
- Successfully dockerized machine learning inference models for optimal resource utilization and isolation.  
- Deployed models as AWS Lambda functions, enabling scalable, serverless execution with reduced operational overhead.  
- **Industrial Master’s Thesis:** “Prediction of Camera Calibration and Distortion Parameters Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data.” Developed a deep learning approach to predict camera calibration and distortion parameters using synthetic datasets to improve accuracy in computer vision applications.
