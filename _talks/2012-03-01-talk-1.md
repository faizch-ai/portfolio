I will be presenting my paper **DeepBrownConrady (DBC)** at [AI Day 2025](https://fcai.fi/ai-day-2025), organized by the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI).  

The talk will cover how DBC leverages deep learning and synthetic data to predict camera calibration and distortion parameters, offering a scalable solution for vision-based systems.
