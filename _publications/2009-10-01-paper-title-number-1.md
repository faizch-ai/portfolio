This paper introduces **DeepBrownConrady (DBC)**, a novel deep learning model that predicts horizontal field of view (H-FOV), principal points, and Brown-Conrady distortion parameters from single input images.  

Key contributions include:  
- A synthetic data pipeline that generates large-scale training datasets for calibration.  
- Robust prediction of intrinsic camera parameters without requiring calibration targets.  
- Validation on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating strong generalization.  

The paper highlights the potential of synthetic data in enabling scalable camera calibration for robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems.
