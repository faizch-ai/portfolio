I recently wrote an article for AILiveSim on the role of **synthetic data in training object detection models**.  

![Synthetic Data for Object Detection](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFd-FBcFEAQMw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1671008664926?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=OtnyDLBsS4yetq_q_SDo91q-TvpKibnGF0LhceRfL5Y)

The piece explores how simulation can:  
- Generate diverse maritime scenarios with controllable parameters (weather, sea-state, object types).  
- Provide high-quality training data without the cost and limitations of real-world collection.  
- Improve model robustness through variability in conditions and objects.
