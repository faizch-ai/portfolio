I‚Äôve published a **Part 2** follow-up for ‚ÄúSynthetic Data for Object Detection‚Äù via AILiveSim, going deeper into the implementation details and additional experiments.

![Synthetic Data for Object Detection, Part 2](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQGabsRIoTWEbw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1674917497591?e=1761177600&v=beta&t=jadH32etRFkLnl7A5vH8Xxn8vwLaDPyQnLlMnHtvDlY)

In this second part, I discuss:

- More advanced scenarios and parameters for synthetic data generation.  
- A deeper look at model performance under different environmental conditions.  
- Discussions about scaling data, domain adaptation, and future directions.
